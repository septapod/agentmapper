# LLM Agent Testing Prompt for AgentMapper

## Your Mission

Complete the AgentMapper workshop as Sarah Chen, CEO of Pacific Coast Credit Union ($2.5B assets, 180K members). Your goal: create a 90-day AI implementation roadmap for **automated loan document processing**.

## Setup

1. Navigate to AgentMapper (localhost:3000 or deployed URL)
2. Complete all 5 sessions with realistic credit union data
3. Track any usability issues, bugs, or confusion as you go

## What to Input (Quick Reference)

### Session 1: Orientation & Shared Understanding
- **Future Headlines:** 5-7 aspirational headlines (e.g., "Loan approvals cut from 5 days to 5 hours")
- **Opportunities:** 8-10 AI ideas across different areas (lending, contact center, compliance, etc.)
- **Guardrails & Principles:** Define 4-6 hard boundaries and 4-6 aspirational guidelines

### Session 2: Find the Friction
- **Friction Points:** Map 5-7 specific pain points (e.g., "Loan officers spend 45 min/app manually extracting data from documents")
- **Opportunity Scoring:** Score each on Value (1-5) and Complexity (1-5)
- **Priority Matrix:** Review auto-generated 2x2 matrix
- **Dot Voting:** Cast 5 votes, select 2 opportunities for pilots (focus on **Automated Loan Document Processing**)

### Session 3: Design the Pilot
- **MVP Spec:** Define scope, tools (Claude, Excel/Sheets, Custom Script), human checkpoints, and success threshold

### Session 4: Create the Roadmap
- **Pilot Plan:** Identify 2-3 test users, metrics to track, duration (4 weeks), and stop criteria
- **90-Day Roadmap:** Create ~10 week-by-week milestones (Build → Pilot → Refine → Scale)

### Session 5: Empower Teams
- **Scaling Checklist:** Review readiness across 5 categories
- **Training Plan:** Define role-based training for 3-4 roles
- **Lessons Learned:** Capture 3-4 items per category (Success, Challenge, Surprise, Recommendation)
- **Next Opportunities:** Prioritize 5-8 future AI projects

## What to Evaluate

As you complete each exercise, note:
- **Usability:** Can you easily navigate, add/edit/delete items, understand what's required?
- **Instructions:** Are goals clear? Do FORGE principles come through?
- **Bugs:** Anything broken (forms not saving, incorrect calculations, UI glitches)?
- **Flow:** Does each session build logically on the previous one?
- **Value:** Does this feel worth the time investment?
