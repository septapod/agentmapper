## Overview

BCG's research on moving AI agents from pilots to scale introduces the **Graduated Autonomy Framework**—a structured approach for organizations to incrementally increase agent independence based on proven performance.

### Core Principle

> "Autonomy is a journey of trust, quantified by accuracy."

> "Freedom within a frame" must include careful risk management drawing on core responsible AI principles—clear risk taxonomies, rigorous testing, continuous monitoring, and built-in resilience from the start.

## The 4-Tier Graduated Autonomy Framework

### Tier 1: Shadow Mode (Agent-Assisted)

**Description:** The agent suggests, the human acts. The agent operates as a "digital whisperer," observing data and drafting options or identifying missing information, much like we use LLMs such as ChatGPT today. The human retains full control and manually executes the final step.

**Purpose:** This is the training ground that allows the organization to validate the agent's logic against the business context without operational risk.

**Characteristics:**
- Zero operational risk
- Agent learns organizational patterns
- Humans validate agent reasoning
- Building trust through observation

---

### Tier 2: Supervised Autonomy (Human-in-the-Loop)

**Description:** Human oversight while the agent performs tasks. Uses "tap-to-approve" workflows where the agent can execute but requires human approval at key decision points.

**Characteristics:**
- Active human participation required
- Approval gates at critical junctures
- Humans can override agent decisions
- Building confidence through controlled execution

---

### Tier 3: Monitored Autonomy (Human-on-the-Loop)

**Description:** Agent acts under policy with monitoring. Human supervision continues but without requiring explicit approval for each action. The agent operates within defined boundaries.

**Characteristics:**
- Passive human oversight
- Policy-based guardrails
- Exception-based intervention
- Humans monitor for anomalies

---

### Tier 4: Full Autonomy (Human-out-of-the-Loop)

**Description:** The agent operates independently without explicit human oversight for defined workflows. Reserved for highly mature, low-risk environments where the cost of error is negligible compared to the gain in efficiency.

**Characteristics:**
- Independent operation
- Post-hoc review only
- Reserved for proven, low-risk tasks
- Highest efficiency, requires highest trust

## Key Implementation Guidance

### Promotion Path
Agents earn their autonomy through proven performance thresholds and rigorous testing. Organizations should:

1. **Start all agents in Tier 1** (Shadow Mode) until they prove alignment with organizational risk appetite
2. **Define promotion criteria** - specific accuracy thresholds, error rates, and time periods
3. **Test rigorously** before promotion to each tier
4. **Monitor continuously** even at higher autonomy levels
5. **Be prepared to demote** if performance degrades

### Risk Management
- Clear risk taxonomies for agent actions
- Rigorous testing at each tier transition
- Continuous monitoring regardless of tier
- Built-in resilience from the start
