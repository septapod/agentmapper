## Overview

McKinsey's QuantumBlack practice analyzed more than 50 agentic AI builds they've led, plus dozens of others in the marketplace, to distill six key lessons for successfully capturing value from agentic AI.

## The 6 Lessons

### Lesson 1: Focus on the Workflow, Not the Agent

**Key Insight:** Achieving business value with agentic AI requires changing workflows. Often, however, organizations focus too much on the agent or the agentic tool itself.

**Implication:** Don't obsess over building "impressive" agents. Think about the whole system, not fun toys. The agent is a means to an end—the workflow transformation is the value.

> "Agentic AI delivers the greatest value when it is used for reengineering business domains rather than simply optimizing existing tasks."

---

### Lesson 2: Reusability Reduces Effort

**Key Insight:** Companies can develop agents and agent components that can easily be reused across different workflows.

**Recommendation:** Develop a centralized set of:
- Validated services (LLM observability, preapproved prompts)
- Reusable assets and components
- Shared infrastructure

**Impact:** This helps to virtually eliminate 30-50% of the nonessential work typically required.

---

### Lesson 3: Data Quality Matters

**Key Insight:** Agents need clean records to function effectively. Data cleanup is a prerequisite, not an afterthought.

**Quote:** "Agents clean records. They try to understand, 'Of the vast universe of potential candidates, how do we clean the data and understand who the right candidate might be?'"

---

### Lesson 4: Process Redesign is Essential

**Key Insight:** This is not automation-as-usual on top of existing processes—it's a redesign of end-to-end processes.

**The High Performer Difference:**
- 55% of AI high performers redesign workflows around AI
- Only 20% of other companies do this
- High performers are 3x more likely to redesign workflows rather than just adding AI to existing processes

> "Agentic AI efforts that focus on fundamentally reimagining entire workflows—the steps that involve people, processes, and technology—are more likely to deliver a positive outcome."

---

### Lesson 5: Humans "Above the Loop"

**Key Insight:** The future isn't humans-in-the-loop (approving every action) but humans-above-the-loop (strategic oversight).

**Implication:** Design systems where humans provide strategic direction and handle exceptions, rather than approving routine agent actions.

---

### Lesson 6: Start with High-Value, Bounded Workflows

**Key Insight:** Don't boil the ocean. Begin with workflows that are:
- High value (meaningful business impact)
- Well-bounded (clear scope and constraints)
- Measurable (success can be quantified)

## Key Statistics (State of AI 2025)

### Adoption
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Organizations using AI in at least one function | 88% |
| Increase from 2024 | +10pp (from 78%) |
| Scaling AI across enterprise | ~33% |
| "AI high performers" (significant EBIT impact) | 6% |
| Experimenting with AI agents | 62% |
| Scaled agent deployments across functions | 12% |
| Planning significant agent investment (6 months) | 50% |

### The Gen AI Paradox
| Finding | Statistic |
|---------|-----------|
| Companies deployed gen AI | ~80% |
| Companies reporting material earnings impact | ~20% |
| Gap explanation | Horizontal use cases (copilots) widely deployed but diffuse benefits; vertical use cases rarely escape pilot phase |

### High Performer Characteristics
| Behavior | High Performers | Others |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Redesign workflows around AI | 55% | 20% |
| Intent to use AI to transform business | 50% | Lower |
| Likelihood to redesign vs. add-on | 3x | 1x |
